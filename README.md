# Reusable ARK Core Module dApp Empty Template Project

This is a basic template project for ARK core dApp development. Create a new project based on this template and load your plugin into the corresponding network configuration by following the steps below.

> This Example is currently operational only on our `core/develop` branch!

This template project provides initial structure for your dApp development.

## dApp Creation Steps

### STEP 0: Create New Project Based On This Template

### STEP 1: Checkout Your New dApp Project As a GitSubmodule in `core/plugins`

You should already have a running core and a local testnet running. If not head over to https://learn.ark.dev/core-getting-started/spinning-up-your-first-testnet#step-2-testnet-network-boot.

```bash
cd plugins/ #location for loading of custom non-core dApps
git submodule add -f https://github.com/your-gh-handle/your-dapp-name
cd your-dapp-name
```

### STEP 2: Load The dApp In The Corresponding Network Configurations.

We will enable our dApp `@vendorname/dappname` in the testnet network configuration. dApp name is taken from `node` package name as defined in package.json.
You can change it to your needs.

Go to:
`core/packages/core/bin/testnet`

```bash
cd packages/core/bin/config/testnet
```

Locate file `plugins.js`. We will add our dApp name to end of the list of the loaded plugins. This means that core will pickup the dapp and load it for a specific network configuration.

Add line `"@arkecosystem/dappname": {}`: to the end of the `plugins.js` file, so it looks something like this:

```javascript
    "@arkecosystem/core-exchange-json-rpc": {
        enabled: process.env.CORE_EXCHANGE_JSON_RPC_ENABLED,
        host: process.env.CORE_EXCHANGE_JSON_RPC_HOST || "0.0.0.0",
        port: process.env.CORE_EXCHANGE_JSON_RPC_PORT || 8080,
        allowRemote: false,
        whitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1"],
    },
    "@arkecosystem/core-snapshots": {},
    "@vendorname/dappname": {}, //our application hook (here we load the plugin/dapp, as defined in your dapp package.json)
```

> Make sure to run `yarn setup` from the `core` root folder when you change or add code to `core/plugins`

After `yarn setup` completes, you should see the following log

```bash
lerna success - @arkecosystem/core-vote-report
lerna success - @arkecosystem/core-wallet-api
lerna success - @arkecosystem/core-webhooks
lerna success - @arkecosystem/core
lerna success - @arkecosystem/crypto
lerna success - @vendorname/dappname
```

Last line showing that your dApp was detected and compiled.

### STEP 3: Start Local Testnet Blockchain

Start local blockchain with testnet running on your developer computer. Follow steps defined in here:
https://learn.ark.dev/core-getting-started/spinning-up-your-first-testnet#step-2-testnet-network-boot

If you already have running and compiled core, you should go to `core/packages/core` and run command `yarn full:testnet`.

After local testnet starts, the log should show that dApp was loaded. It should look like this (if you haven't changed the source code):

```bash
[2019-10-22 11:13:27.161] INFO : Starting dApp
[2019-10-22 11:13:27.161] INFO : Initialization of dApp
```

> Congratulations. Your first distributed blockchain application is loaded and working and compatible with any ARK Core based blockchain.

Feel free to look into `common/base-service.ts` class that exposes important Core Platform classes that you can work with. Your newly developed classes can extend this class and gain access to:

-   wallets and state
-   transaction pool
-   blockchain protocol
-   events
-   database
    -... actually any module :)

> Also check other packages/modules as they follow the same dApp structure.
